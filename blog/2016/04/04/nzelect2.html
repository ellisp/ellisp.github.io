  <h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>This post is the second in a series that make up my entry in <a href="http://www.arilamstein.com/blog/2016/03/28/announcing-r-election-analysis-contest/">Ari Lamstein’s R Election Analysis Contest</a>,  <a href="/blog/2016/04/03/nzelect1/">Yesterday</a> I introduced the <a href="https://github.com/ellisp/nzelect"><code class="highlighter-rouge">nzelect</code> R package</a> from a user perspective.  Today I’m writing about how the build of that package works.  This might be of interest to someone planning on doing something similar, or to anyone who wants to contribute to <code class="highlighter-rouge">nzelect</code>.</p>

<p>Here’s today’s themes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Structure - separation of the preparation from the package</li>
  <li>Modular code</li>
  <li>Specific techniques - combining multiple CSVs, and overlaying spatial points and shapefiles</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="structure">Structure</h2>
<p>Here’s the directory structure within the Git repo that builds this package, with the individual files in the key <code class="highlighter-rouge">./prep/</code> folder shown on the right:</p>

<p><img src="/img/0036-structure.png" alt="structure" /></p>

<p>You can view, fork and clone the whole project for yourself if interested from <a href="https://github.com/ellisp/nzelect">GitHub</a>.  The code excerpts in this blog post won’t run if you just paste them into R; they need a specific folder structure that comes from running them in a clone of the main project.</p>

<p>Conceptually, there are three main parts of this project:</p>

<ul>
  <li>downloads and data munging that need to be done separately to the published R package, and which include products like data tidying scripts and downloaded raw data which must not be included in the package itself.  This comprises the <code class="highlighter-rouge">prep</code> and  <code class="highlighter-rouge">downloads</code> folders</li>
  <li>The R package itself, which is in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">pkg</code> folder and includes subdirectories for <code class="highlighter-rouge">data</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">man</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">R</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">tests</code> folders</li>
  <li>secondary material which depends on the R package being in existence and installed, such as the <code class="highlighter-rouge">README</code> for the GitHub repo, extended examples in <code class="highlighter-rouge">examples</code> including a Shiny app which will be the subject of the next post, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>There’s also various administrative stuff, such as the <code class="highlighter-rouge">.git</code> folder holding the version control database, <code class="highlighter-rouge">.Rproj.user</code> holding information on the RStudio project, the <code class="highlighter-rouge">travis.yml</code> file that sets up hooks from GitHub to Travis Continuous Integration, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">nzelect.Rcheck</code> holding the latest version of the R package build checks.</p>

<p>This is a typical structure for me.  I generally don’t like an R package based in the root folder of a project.  I nearly always have a bunch of stuff I want to do - prep and extended examples - that I don’t want in the built and published version of the package for end users, but I do want kept together with the code building the package in a single RStudio project and Git repository.</p>

<p>The project is held together by a script entitled <code class="highlighter-rouge">build.R</code>.  In other projects this would make sense as a <code class="highlighter-rouge">makefile</code> but my workflow with <code class="highlighter-rouge">nzelect</code> is quite interactive (I pick and choose which files to run during development) and I’m more comfortable doing that with an R script.  In principle it should work if run end to end with a fresh clone of the repository, and it looks like this:</p>

<h2 id="modular-code">Modular code</h2>
<p>Looking at that <code class="highlighter-rouge">build.R</code> script introduces my second theme for today - modularity.  I have separate scripts for different tasks such as “download election results”, “download shapefiles” and “tidy voting place results”.  This makes development easier to keep track of, and easier to run and debug a whole script at once without repeating expensive processes like downloads.  Note that the downloaded data isn’t tracked by Git - that would bloat out the repository too much, so all downloads are covered in the .gitignore instead.</p>

<p>Some of those scripts are very short.  For example, <code class="highlighter-rouge">download_map_shapefiles.R</code> is only 8 lines long including blanks:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-r" data-lang="r"><span class="c1"># ./prep/download_map_shapefiles.R

              </span><span class="n">destfile</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"downloads/shapefiles/2014_boundaries.zip"</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">mode</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"wb"</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w">

<p>This sort of thing is key for maintainability.  If multiple people are working on a project, it also stops them treading on eachothers’ toes working on the same files at once.</p>

<h2 id="specific-techniques">Specific techniques</h2>
<p>I won’t go through the whole project - that’s easiest done for yourself if interested from a clone of it - but will highlight three more things.</p>

<h3 id="munging-the-electoral-commission-csvs">Munging the Electoral Commission CSVs</h3>
<p>The 2014 general election results are published on the web in the form of 71 CSV files for candidate vote (one per electorate) and 71 CSV files for party vote.  Each CSV has data on each voting place used by voters enrolled in the electorate (voting places are not necessarily physically in the electorate).  Here’s a screenshot of a typical CSV:</p>

<p><img src="/img/0036-csv.png" alt="csv" /></p>

<p>As can be seen, they go some way towards being nicely machine readable, but are not yet in tidy shape.</p>

<p>Some features of these CSVs include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the name of the electorate is in cell A2</li>
  <li>the main body of data starts in row 3</li>
  <li>column A of the main data represents suburb, and a blank represents “same as previous entry”</li>
  <li>the final row of the main data (not shown) is always a Total, followed by a row that is blank for columns A:E</li>
  <li>below the main data rectangle there is a secondary rectangle of data (not shown) with data on candidates that is otherwise not presented (ie which party the candidates represent) as well as sum totals of their votes</li>
</ul>

<p>Luckily, each CSV has an identical pattern - not identical numbers of rows and columns, but enough pattern that it is possible to programmatically identify the main data rectangle.  For example, after skipping the first three rows, the next empty cell in column B indicates the main data rectangle is finished, and the row above that cell is the sum total (which needs to be excluded).  Here’s the part of the tidying script that deals with those candidate CSVs:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-r" data-lang="r"><span class="c1"># ./prep/tidy_votingplace_results.R
# imports previously downloaded CSVs of election results by voting place.

<h3 id="overlaying-shapefiles">Overlaying shapefiles</h3>
<p>One important task was to take the point locations (in NZTM coordinates) of the 2,500 or so voting places and determine which meshblock, area unit, Territorial Authority and Regional Council each was in.  Luckily this is a piece of cake with the <code class="highlighter-rouge">over()</code> function from the <code class="highlighter-rouge">sp</code> package.  The process is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>import a shapefile of the boundaries we want (the originals are at http://www.stats.govt.nz/browse_for_stats/Maps_and_geography/Geographic-areas/digital-boundary-files.aspx and a script in the project downloads the versions for 2014) into R as a <code class="highlighter-rouge">sp::SpatialPolygonsDataFrame</code> object</li>
  <li>use the proj4string from that shapefile to help convert the NZTM coordinates into a <code class="highlighter-rouge">sp::SpatialPoints</code> object</li>
  <li>use <code class="highlighter-rouge">sp::over()</code> to map the SpatialPoints to the SpatialPolygonsDataFrame.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="unit-tests">Unit tests</h3>
<p>Any serious coding project needs unit tests so you can be sure that things, once fixed, continue to work as you make changes to other parts of the project.  This applies as much to analytical projects as to software development.  Hadley Wickham’s <code class="highlighter-rouge">testthat</code> package gives a nice structure for including unit tests in the actual check and build of an R package, and I use that in this project.  Here’s some of the tests I’m using, in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">./pkg/tests/testthat/</code> directory:</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The three themes for today:</p>

<ul>
  <li>structure - separating prep, package, and extended use</li>
  <li>modularity</li>
  <li>a few specific techniques of data cleaning</li>
</ul>

<p>That’s enough for now.  Stay tuned for the next post in the series, which looks at the Shiny app I built as an extended example of use of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">nzelect</code> package.</p>
