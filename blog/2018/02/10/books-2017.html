   I outline some of the books that I read for the first time in 2017 that relate to statistics and data

  <p>I last <a href="http://127.0.0.1:4000/blog/2017/01/14/books">blogged about books in September 2016</a> and it’s still in my 10 most popular posts.  I thought I’d update it with some of the data-relevant books I read in 2017.  Mostly these are books that weren’t <em>published</em> in 2017 - it’s just that it was last year that I got around to reading them.  I read a lot of books, and most of them aren’t directly relevant for here (although I always look for interesting topics eg in history that might lead to a post).  So I’m only going to talk about those which are somehow related to statistics or data science, and which I rated 3 stars or more.  I try to calibrate my ratings to the <a href="https://debsanswers.wordpress.com/2011/07/07/what-do-goodreads-ratings-mean/">Goodreads star system</a>, so 3 stars means “I liked it” and I’d be happy recommending people to read it.  Whereas 5 stars means something that really made an impact on me, and was enjoyable to read to boot.  In the data context, it probably means I’m doing things differently as a result of that book - new techniques, better practice, new ideas, or something.</p>

<p>So here’s some books I read and liked in 2017, with the most important first</p>

<h2 id="stars">5 stars</h2>

<h4 id="ralph-kimball-and-margy-ross-the-data-warehouse-toolkit-the-definitive-guide-to-dimensional-modelinghttpswwwamazoncomdata-warehouse-toolkit-definitive-dimensionaldp1118530802">Ralph Kimball and Margy Ross <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Data-Warehouse-Toolkit-Definitive-Dimensional/dp/1118530802">The Data Warehouse Toolkit: The Definitive Guide to Dimensional Modeling</a></h4>

<p>In 2017 I found myself much deeper and more hands on in the world of data warehousing than I had been, and I did some reading to catch up.  I knew a bit about the basics of data modelling for relational databases, and was vaguely familiar with thinking in terms of “facts” and “dimensions”, but I had some big gaps in that knowledge.  This book was a massive eye-opener, and page after page I found myself saying “yes that makes sense!” “I should have thought of that” and “I wish I’d known that before”.</p>

<p>I can’t recommend this book enough; if you’re a statistician or data scientist who wants to understand how databases can be used to support analytics, this is the one book I’d tell you is a “must read”.  There’s key terminology to help you talk with IT; established good practice based on years of learning the hard way in building datamarts and combining them into warehouses; and lots of good thoughts on structuring data, handling change, and organising thoughts about data that you’ll find useful even if you’re not designing and building a database.</p>

<p>This is also the one book I wish everyone in IT had read.  Data warehousing is different to other database design.  It has particular problems, and it has standard, tried-and-true solutions.  We shouldn’t have to reinvent this stuff all the time.  For example, US agriculture dept showed that surveys can be stored in a single database with Kimball-style dimensional modeling - only X tables. (link, image)</p>

<p>2017 was the year I determined to update my (very basic) understanding of practical modern Bayesianism, and <em>Statistical Rethinking</em> was one of a half dozen books I started on the subject (a few of them I haven’t finished yet, particularly two great Andrew Gelman numbers, so won’t be mentioned in this post).  It’s well written, humourous and very very eye-opening.  I now recommend it to all sorts of people.  I think it’s particularly perfect for people who learnt stats the bad way (ie cookbooks) and need a jolt to point them in the much more sustainable and scalable direction of thinking in terms of principles, how we know what we know and philosophy of science.  It’s also good for anyone in the position I was - wanting a friendly introduction into the modern Bayesian world.</p>

<p>I read this book end to end without doing the exercises because that’s my learning style, they also look really useful for people who like that sort of thing.  I also don’t use the R package that came with it as an intermediary between R and Stan but went straight to writing my own Stan programs; that will be a matter of preference.  The book was great as an introduction to Stan when it came to that part, but for me it was its conceptual clarity and communicative teaching style that was really valuable.</p>
