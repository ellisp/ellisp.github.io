		<title>free range statistics</title>
		<description>I write about applications of data and analytical techniques like statistical modelling and simulation to real-world situations. I show how to access and use data, and provide examples of analytical products and the code that produced them.</description>

				<title>Ten year anniversary of Free Range Statistics</title>
				        
				
				
					<description>A reflection on ten years, 225 posts and 350,000 words of the Free Range Statistics blog. Blogging works for me because it meets my own needs in the first instance, particularly by motivating learning and giving me a structured platform to engage with things I find interesting.</description>

					<description>A few specific notes on technical issues relating to a previous post. On drawing network graphs with different coloured edges; modelling strategy; different specifications of models; and accessing UN SDG and gender inequality data.</description>

				<title>Men&apos;s domestic chores and fertility rates - Part I</title>
				        
				
				
					<description>The time that men spend on domestic chores is positively related to total fertility rate. But only if you are looking at countries selected because they are rich. Overall, it&apos;s negatively related. And if you model it with both GDP per capita and gender inequality (generally, more country-level gender inequality means more children), the effect goes away altogether. At the country level, it&apos;s a statistical artefact. To look into this properly, you need individual and household-level data.</description>

				<title>Sankey plots can work, but need polishing like any other graphic</title>
				        
				
				
					<description>I set out to improve a Sankey plot that had been shared as an example of how bad they are, and hopefully show that some careful design decisions and polish can make these plot useful for purposes like seeing cohorts&apos; progress (up, down, same) over time.</description>

				<title>More on power and &apos;fragile&apos; p-values</title>
				        
				
				
					<description>Some more comprehensive simulations of what happens to &apos;fragile&apos; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; values (those between 0.01 and 0.05), when the actual power differs from the minimum detectable difference that an 80% power calculation was depended upon to set the sample size.</description>

					<description>What proportion of significant &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; values should be between 0.01 and 0.05? Turns out the answer is &apos;it depends&apos;.</description>

				<title>World Economic Outlook</title>
				        
				
				
					<description>I have a quick look at the latest World Economic Outlook released by the IMF, with a particular eye on the economic growth forecasts for Pacific island countries. The Pacific countries that have had the biggest revision downwards in their growth prospects over the six months since the last Outlook are the three in the Compact of Free Association with USA (Palau, Marshall Islands, and Federated States of Micronesia), plus Fiji.</description>
