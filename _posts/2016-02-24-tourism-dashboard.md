Just a short note that in my day job we've released the [New Zealand Tourism Dashboard](https://mbienz.shinyapps.io/tourism_dashboard_prod/), launched by the [Associate Minister for Tourism earlier today](http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PA1602/S00350/new-tool-to-improve-tourism-data-use.htm).  It's built with R and Shiny and I won't say more about it than that to avoid mixing up my work and outside-work hats.  Except that it's really really awesome, and there's an enormous amount of data in there to explore.  Great work by the team.
