At the conference of the New Zealand Association of Economists (NZAE) in late June 2016 I gave a paper on Modelled Territorial Authority Gross Domestic Product, a new dataset my team developed last year in my day job.  See the [official website of the MTAGDP project](http://www.mbie.govt.nz/info-services/sectors-industries/regions-cities/research/modelled-territorial-authority-gross-domestic-product) for definitive information.  I [briefly blogged](/blog/2015/10/30/MTAGDP) about the data when it was first released in October 2015; since then it has been updated and enhanced.

The papers from the conference were originally planned to be [published on the NZAE website](http://www.nzaeconference.co.nz/presenters-info.cfm) but this doesn't seem to have happened so I've put mine up in the ["presentations" part of my blog](/presentations/index.html) instead.

* [Full paper (PDF)](/presentations/ellis-mtagdp.pdf) - the only manifestation that's really aimed at being reader-friendly
* [Presentation](presentations/ellisp-mtagdp-presentation.html) - visual props, doesn't tell the story by itself but looks nice
* [Source code](https://github.com/ellisp/mtagdp-nzae) - source code for my contribution at the conference, including the analysis in R, paper in LaTeX and the Rmarkdown / reveal.js code of the presentation.  Not the source code for creating Modelled Territorial Authority GDP estimates, which is published elsewhere (links in the paper)

## Some visual highlights
The paper talks about how we developed these estimates and has some example analysis demonstrating possible use case.  For example, I fit a generalized additive model to economic growth from 2005 to 2015 to see if it could be explained in part by the absolute level of GDP or the importance of agriculture at the beginning of the period, while correcting for spatial auto-correlation (spoiler - found no evidence of a link). 

Without wanting to paraphrase the whole paper again in this blog, here are some visual highlights.  Explanations are in the [full paper](/presentations/ellis-mtagdp.pdf).

-------------------

### Which districts and cities have similar industry profiles?

-------------------

### Which industries tend to be spatially related?
![b](/img/0054-industry-associations.svg)

-------------------

### How do agriculture and GDP in 2005 relate to subsequent growth? (not much)

-------------------

### How does construction in Taranaki get allocated to sub-industries and districts?

-------------------

### How does the data look in its [web app built with Shiny](http://www.mbie.govt.nz/info-services/sectors-industries/regions-cities/research/modelled-territorial-authority-gross-domestic-product/interactive-web-tool)? (Note the machine-generated interpretation / commentary on the right side of the screen)

-------------------

### Which districts and cities had the highest growth rates 2005 to 2015?

-------------------

### What's the GDP growth map of New Zealand look like?

-------------------

### What about if we smooth the growth patterns and draw it like a funky weather map instead?

## Accessing the data

The full source code for the conference paper and its analysis is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/ellisp/mtagdp-nzae), but here's a much shorter snippet of R code to download the data in two tables from the definitive location on the [MBIE website](http://www.mbie.govt.nz/info-services/sectors-industries/regions-cities/research/modelled-territorial-authority-gross-domestic-product/data-download):

* TAGDP_public contains industry breakdowns to 2013 (about 11MB)
* mtagdp_totals is aggregate GDP (no industry breakdown) to 2015 (<1MB)

{% highlight R %}
    TAGDP_public <- read.csv("http://www.mbie.govt.nz/info-services/sectors-industries/regions-cities/research/modelled-territorial-authority-gross-domestic-product/resolveuid/98debb063cb14ecbab0f018b7681e7f4",
                   stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
    mtagdp_totals <- read.csv("http://www.mbie.govt.nz/info-services/sectors-industries/regions-cities/research/modelled-territorial-authority-gross-domestic-product/resolveuid/b811fea8196c4d269c1d5ca973933c7c",
                              stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

Comments, questions and suggestions welcomed.  If they're about my example analysis or basic "how do I use the data" I'll answer them here; if they get controversial or about the development method I'll swap hats and refer them back to work.
