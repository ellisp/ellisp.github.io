## Motivation
This post is the third in a series that make up my entry in [Ari Lamstein's R Election Analysis Contest](http://www.arilamstein.com/blog/2016/03/28/announcing-r-election-analysis-contest/).  

[First](/blog/2016/04/03/nzelect1/) I introduced the [`nzelect` R package](https://github.com/ellisp/nzelect) from a user perspective.  [Second](/blog/2016/04/04/nzelect2/) was a piece on how the build of that package works.  Today, the third in the series introduces an interactive map of results by voting location drawing on the data in `nzelect`, built with Shiny.

## Overview
The point of the tool is to facilitate comparison of support for parties by fine grained location, well below the electorate level that is usually used as the area of analysis. I've included data for the party vote of the eight most successful parties in the 2014 election.  Party vote determines the ultimate make up of Parliament (see [this previous post](/blog/2016/04/03/nzelect1/) for a brief discussion of how the New Zealand system works) and is more comparable across locations than is candidate vote for a number of reasons.

Here's the Shiny app in action:
<div style="height: 647px">
<iframe id="scaled-frame" width="980" src="https://ellisp.shinyapps.io/NZ-general-election-2014/" style = "overflow-y: hidden;"></iframe>
</div>

Most users will prefer the [full screen version](https://ellisp.shinyapps.io/NZ-general-election-2014/).

What you can do with this app includes:

* you can use the drop down box to add circles representing the percentage of vote at any voting place for each of up to 8 parties.  Each time you select a new party, it adds new circles on the front of the graphic - so if you want to compare two parties it's a good idea to choose the more popular (for your shown location) first, and overlay the less popular one on top of it
* you can move the map around to a part of New Zealand you're interested in and zoom in or out, and the markers will resize to be visible
* you can click on the individual circles to get a tooltip showing the actual number of votes for that party in that location (only really readable in the full screen version).
* you can rescale the circles - recommended if you're looking at parties other than Labour, National and Green.

It's definitely most interesting when you're comparing two parties.  Remember that these data show the locations where people voted (on a Saturday), which is presumed to be generally close to but not identical to where they live and / or (less likely) work.  Here's some snapshots of interesting contrasts:

### New Zealand First compared to Maori Party in the Northland area  
![northland](/img/0037-northland.png)

New Zealand First outperformed the Maori Party comprehensively in Northland, showing there's no inevitable link from higher proportions of Maori ethnicity to supporting the party of that name.  More exploring shows the Maori Party's strongest support in parts of Bay of Plenty, Taupo and Gisborne (upper right north island, for non-New Zealanders, and like Northland, concentrations of people with Maori ethnicity).

### National compared to Labour in Auckland
![auckland](/img/0037-auckland.png)

The fine grained pattern of National Party (blue circle) support compared to the Labour Party in Auckland's inner suburbs is extremely marked:

* Near parity in the city centre; 
* National dominance in the eastern and (to a lesser extent) northern inner suburbs; 
* Labour stronger around Tamaki (to the right of the image) plus some pockets in the south-west.

### Greens compared to Labour in Wellington
![wellington](/img/0037-wellington.png)

The two main parties of the left in New Zealand are Labour and the Greens.  Green Party support relative to Labour Party in the Wellington area is a very regional phenomenon.   Green party votes in 2014 were focused in the inner city and suburbs with small patches in other suburbs that perhaps are unsurprising to political tacticians who know Wellington's spatial socio-demographics.  This follows the trend (in New Zealand and similar countries) for the educated, well off, younger left to more generally support the Greens than the older parties of the left.  Note the traditional working class Labour Party strongholds in Lower Hutt and Wainuiomata areas.

## A trick with leaflet and Shiny
The web app is put together with [shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) and [leaflet](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/).  This next snippet of blog assumes the reader knows the basics of Shiny and is interested in specifics related to this app.

The source code of the Shiny app is at [https://github.com/ellisp/nzelect/tree/master/examples/leaflet](https://github.com/ellisp/nzelect/tree/master/examples/leaflet).  There's some prep done to create the necessary data files elsewhere in the repository at [https://github.com/ellisp/nzelect/blob/master/prep/shiny_prep.R](https://github.com/ellisp/nzelect/blob/master/prep/shiny_prep.R).  I won't go through it line by line but will point out one interesting feature now available with leaflet and R.  The `leafletProxy()` function in the `leaflet` package, in combination with `observe()` from `shiny`, let's you delete or redraw elements of an existing leaflet map that the user has zoomed in or out on and changed its location, without redrawing the whole map.  This is essential for a decent user experience and wasn't in the early releases of the `leaflet` R package.

In case someone else is interested in it here is an excerpt from the `shiny.R` file of my Shiny app showing how the existing map `MyMap` gets circles added to it when the reactive object `the_data()` changes as a result of the user picking a new political party to show.  In this case, a new set of circles is added with `addCircleMarkers()`, superimposed over whatever is currently on the map.

{% highlight R lang lineanchors %}
observe({
     leafletProxy("MyMap", data = the_data()$df) %>%
            addCircleMarkers(~WGS84Longitude, 
                             ~WGS84Latitude,
                             color = the_data()$thecol,
                             radius = ~prop * 30 * input$sc,
                             popup = ~lab) 
    })
{% endhighlight %}    

Similarly, here's the trick I use to clear all the circle markers when the user presses the button labelled "Clear all parties".  That button increases the value of `input$clear1` by one, and by referring to it inside an observer with the otherwise pointless `x <- input$clear1` (see below) I activate that observer, which then updates the selected party to be blank, and clears all the markers off `MyMap`.

{% highlight R lang lineanchors %}    
    observe({
        x <- input$clear1
        updateSelectInput(session, "party", selected = "")
        leafletProxy("MyMap") %>% clearMarkers()
    })
{% endhighlight %}    

That's all for today.  Happy [exploring the fine grained details of New Zealand voting locations](https://ellisp.shinyapps.io/NZ-general-election-2014/).  If you spot a bug or other issue please [file an issue with the `nzelect` project](https://github.com/ellisp/nzelect/issues).
