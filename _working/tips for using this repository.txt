# during development

Open 3 shell windows - 2 in in the root directory, and one in _site

In the root directory run jekyll serve from one shell, and use the other to stage and commit things to the <source> branch.
You might want to use the <dev> branch and periodically merge it into <source>.  From here you shoudl periodically push to git push origin source - never git push origin master

The _site directory is a git repo within a repo, and it is the <master> branch.  The master branch is what github picks up to broadcast as the actual web page.  You should git push origin master (never git push origin source) from here to actually publish something
